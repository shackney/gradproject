<summary>Internship Experience</summary>

Coming into college at the University of Tulsa, I declared a major in accounting but was unsure whether it would be a good fit for me.  After my first few accounting courses, I discovered that I was really enjoying the course content and figured a career in accounting would be stable, secure, and dependable.  Along the way, I took CIS2003, which essentially provided an introductory overview to a lot of CIS topics that were expanded upon in more advanced courses.  This CIS course was part of the course requirement for all students with business majors, so I enrolled out of obligation.  However, I found that I was fairly adept at mastering the subject matter and looked further into the possibility of studying CIS in addition to accounting.  I attended an informational luncheon with all of the CIS professors to learn more about what the major would entail. Throughout the rest of my undergraduate years, I switched a few times back and forth between a CIS major and a minor, but ultimately was able to fit the requirements for a major into my courseload.  
<br>
When it came time to think about career paths, I knew I would prefer a job that would appeal to my interests in both accounting and CIS.  I figured that there were a few different options: corporate accounting, auditor, or IT auditor.  I aimed to try each of these in hopes of discovering what I could see myself doing on a daily basis for an extended period of time.  My first internship was with Phillips 66 the summer after my sophomore year.  I served as a finance intern in the marketing financial services group.  I found this internship to be a great first experience.  My specific sub-group dealt with fuel consignment and accounting for stations that owned the brick and mortar gas station but sold Phillips 66 fuel.  The internship was a whole provided a complete look into the oil and gas value chain.  The intern class took trips to the Houston headquarters, Ponca City refinery, Glenpool terminals, and several other sites.  On a daily basis, much of my responsibility was to receive reports from the consignment operator detailing their sales, fuel volumes, etc and reconciling this to the company ERP. I was tasked with finding errors in the report and performing several analytics procedures to find any unusual trends.  I was also given a second project that involved creating a macro in Excel to format incoming aviation fuel sales data in a way that was compatible with direct entry into their system. While I loved the company culture and the internship as a whole, I felt my specific position was not fast-paced enough to entertain me for 40 hours a week, and began thinking about other options for work.

<br>
During the following school year, I discussed with my CIS professors options for my next internship.  Once suggestion I was given was for Stinnett & Associates, a firm that was not extremely involved on the TU campus at that point.  However, two company representatives attended a fall Beta Alpha Psi meeting, at which time I approached them and expressed my interest in an internship.  I went through the hiring process which included an office tour, and accepted an internship for the following summer.  I expressed to them that I was interested in both the accounting and IT aspect of things; they offered to allow me experience in both areas throughout the summer.  Stinnett is essentially a client services firm, and a majority of the jobs I was on included outsourced internal auditing or IT work for clients.  Many days we would be working from our client's office requesting documentation and performing control tests for SOX compliance.  The second half of my internship was more IT-focused and consisted of testing IT SOX controls or documenting clients' cybersecurity procedures in order to provide recommendations.  I found the cybersecurity discussions to consist largely of topics I had learned in previous CIS courses such as telcommunications, and enjoyed applying that knowledge to real-world concepts.  However, I still wanted to gain experience in the public accounting industry, as I know that those positions are typically the most challenging and fast-moving (and stressful).

<br><br>
Through the required accounting curriculum, there is opportunity to work in a spring internship for the first nine weeks of the semester, and take the rest of the courses compressed for the second nine weeks.  I chose to work with HoganTaylor, a local public accounting firm in Tulsa.  Through this internship, I was on four different audit teams assisting with the audits of our client's financial statements.  Specifically, I audited the cash accounts, managed analysis of the expense fluctuations, and confirmed accounts receivable balances.  Working with the financial statements did not come as easily to me as I expected throughout my accounting courses, so I knew I wanted to try IT auditing to utilize more of my CIS knowledge.  The following summer, I interned for PwC in Portland, Oregon on their Risk Assurance team.  I was firstly impressed with the global reach of the company and the resources and network available to the employees.  For a majority of my internship, I was working at the Nike headquarters in Beaverton helping to audit the company's IT controls.  For the last portion of my internship, I was working with a utilities company performing the same duties.  Ultimately, I enjoyed my day-to-day responsibilities at PwC the most, and chose to accept a position with them full time as a Risk Assurance Associate in their OKC office, a position that I will begin in August 2019.
