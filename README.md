<summary>CISA Exam</summary>

<ul>
 <li>
 The CISA exam, which stands for Certified Information Systems auditor, is a common achievement for those in professions that combine accounting and computer information systems knowledge.  The responsibilities of a financial statement auditor is vastly different from that of an IT auditor, so it is extremely important that the individuals designing and performing the tests on the client's systems have the experience necessary to understand potential risks and underlying processes.  The exam is completed in a single sitting and is sponsored by ISACA, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association.  The material is split into five distinct subject areas, also referred to as domains.  The first domain is "The Process of Auditing Information Systems."  This covers generic auditing procedures, especially for individuals that do not have any audit experience.  It also delves into the purpose of auditing these systems and what specific requirements or processes might need examination.  The second domain is "Governance and Management of IT."  Auditing a client's IT environment consists of more than just verifying the processes and outputs of the client's systems.  It is also important that the client has policies and procedures in place that keep these systems secure and manages access to them.  IT processes must be continually examined for adequacy and safety.  Next, the third domain is "Information Systems Acquisition, Development, and Implementation," which would most importantly be useful when auditing client systems that were developed in house for which there are no standards or familiar features.  Additionally, clients must take special care when deploying new IT systems in their company to ensure security, appropriate access, and reliable outputs.  Fourth is the "Information Systems Operations, Maintenance, and Service Management" domain, which considers the day-to-day functionality of IT systems, updates, patches, repairs, IT support, etc.  Lastly, the "Protection of Information Assets" domain involves ensuring that the client's IT systems and the information contained in them are secure and contain appropriate safeguard controls.  These five domains make up the subject matter tested on the CISA exam. <br>

<summary>Internship Experience</summary>

Coming into college at the University of Tulsa, I declared a major in accounting but was unsure whether it would be a good fit for me.  After my first few accounting courses, I discovered that I was really enjoying the course content and figured a career in accounting would be stable, secure, and dependable.  Along the way, I took CIS2003, which essentially provided an introductory overview to a lot of CIS topics that were expanded upon in more advanced courses.  This CIS course was part of the course requirement for all students with business majors, so I enrolled out of obligation.  However, I found that I was fairly adept at mastering the subject matter and looked further into the possibility of studying CIS in addition to accounting.  I attended an informational luncheon with all of the CIS professors to learn more about what the major would entail. Throughout the rest of my undergraduate years, I switched a few times back and forth between a CIS major and a minor, but ultimately was able to fit the requirements for a major into my courseload.  
<br>
When it came time to think about career paths, I knew I would prefer a job that would appeal to my interests in both accounting and CIS.  I figured that there were a few different options: corporate accounting, auditor, or IT auditor.  I aimed to try each of these in hopes of discovering what I could see myself doing on a daily basis for an extended period of time.  My first internship was with Phillips 66 the summer after my sophomore year.  I served as a finance intern in the marketing financial services group.  I found this internship to be a great first experience.  My specific sub-group dealt with fuel consignment and accounting for stations that owned the brick and mortar gas station but sold Phillips 66 fuel.  The internship was a whole provided a complete look into the oil and gas value chain.  The intern class took trips to the Houston headquarters, Ponca City refinery, Glenpool terminals, and several other sites.  On a daily basis, much of my responsibility was to receive reports from the consignment operator detailing their sales, fuel volumes, etc and reconciling this to the company ERP. I was tasked with finding errors in the report and performing several analytics procedures to find any unusual trends.  I was also given a second project that involved creating a macro in Excel to format incoming aviation fuel sales data in a way that was compatible with direct entry into their system. While I loved the company culture and the internship as a whole, I felt my specific position was not fast-paced enough to entertain me for 40 hours a week, and began thinking about other options for work.

<br>
During the following school year, I discussed with my CIS professors options for my next internship.  Once suggestion I was given was for Stinnett & Associates, a firm that was not extremely involved on the TU campus at that point.  However, two company representatives attended a fall Beta Alpha Psi meeting, at which time I approached them and expressed my interest in an internship.  I went through the hiring process which included an office tour, and accepted an internship for the following summer.  I expressed to them that I was interested in both the accounting and IT aspect of things; they offered to allow me experience in both areas throughout the summer.  Stinnett is essentially a client services firm, and a majority of the jobs I was on included outsourced internal auditing or IT work for clients.  Many days we would be working from our client's office requesting documentation and performing control tests for SOX compliance.  The second half of my internship was more IT-focused and consisted of testing IT SOX controls or documenting clients' cybersecurity procedures in order to provide recommendations.  I found the cybersecurity discussions to consist largely of topics I had learned in previous CIS courses such as telcommunications, and enjoyed applying that knowledge to real-world concepts.  However, I still wanted to gain experience in the public accounting industry, as I know that those positions are typically the most challenging and fast-moving (and stressful).

<br><br>
Through the required accounting curriculum, there is opportunity to work in a spring internship for the first nine weeks of the semester, and take the rest of the courses compressed for the second nine weeks.  I chose to work with HoganTaylor, a local public accounting firm in Tulsa.  Through this internship, I was on four different audit teams assisting with the audits of our client's financial statements.  Specifically, I audited the cash accounts, managed analysis of the expense fluctuations, and confirmed accounts receivable balances.  Working with the financial statements did not come as easily to me as I expected throughout my accounting courses, so I knew I wanted to try IT auditing to utilize more of my CIS knowledge.  The following summer, I interned for PwC in Portland, Oregon on their Risk Assurance team.  I was firstly impressed with the global reach of the company and the resources and network available to the employees.  For a majority of my internship, I was working at the Nike headquarters in Beaverton helping to audit the company's IT controls.  For the last portion of my internship, I was working with a utilities company performing the same duties.  Ultimately, I enjoyed my day-to-day responsibilities at PwC the most, and chose to accept a position with them full time as a Risk Assurance Associate in their OKC office, a position that I will begin in August 2019.

<summary>Potential Career</summary>
The career that I will be beginning in August is that of IT auditing.  IT auditors are most commonly certified as CISAs, but it is also not unusual to have CPA certifications as well.  I am hoping to obtain both within the first year of starting my position.  IT auditing is most generally for the purpose of testing controls related to a client's IT environment and processes to ensure that the client is compliant with SOX regulations.  The SOX act was initiated following several impactful financial frauds at the turn of the millenium.  For all public companies, SOX requires that specific controls are implemented and maintained by the clients as well as certified by external auditors so that financial statement users can be confident that the statements are accurately represented.  In the IT realm, more and more of companies' transactions are taking place online and are stored digitally or in the cloud.  This requires controls that ensure the appropriate individuals have access, authority to change permissions/features, and secure storage and backups of information.  Common domains that classify IT controls include change management, access, backup and recovery, and computer operations.

<summary>The Future of Accounting</summary>
One of the important concepts stressed throughout my accounting coursework was the need to be proficient in financial concepts and maintain an attitude of innovation and efficiency.  Many people are worried that with the rise in technology in all areas of life, jobs for accountants may slowly be replaced by computers and/or robots, until they are completely eliminated.  However, this is not entirely the case.  As technology is most useful when it first replaces the mundane jobs that do not require creative thought, accountants must ensure that they provide more through their positions than completion of simple and repetitive tasks.  After all, most of the existing technology that is currently used in the accounting and auditing professions requires extensive training and repetition in order to learn patterns in the data. As an example, one major auditing firm is using a data mining algorithm to examine online credit card transactions to predict which are most likely to result from fraud. Other auditing technologies can be used to select samples for testing, examine transactional data, and identify areas of specific risk in a client's financial data.  What humans can add to the auditing process is creative thought and decision-making that is not as easily trained or data driven. They can also add the personal interaction and consulting services that are the most valuable to client relationships.  In the future, it is possible that much of what accountants currently do could be replaced; however, the individuals that are most knowledgeable about the financial statements or IT systems and understand how the technology should be programmed and utilized will still be extremely useful.

<summary>Commentary on Tech Trainings</summary>
The first training for GitHub I found to be extremely useful.  A majority of the modules had practical applications to personal use of Github as well as responsibilities through a job.  I do not have experience using Github or coding at an internship thus far, but I can understand how the commits and branches would be utilized in a practical setting.  Even the assignment to make a tech resume has further increased my proficiency using Github, and I have learned additional functionalities that were not required in the training modules.  I would recommend that this continues to be required for future classes, as I believe is the plan.
 
I found the Linux and AWS trainings to be the most difficult, as they were more technically dense than Github or PowerBI.  However, having basic knowledge gained from the trainings will undoubtedly be helpful, even if not used in future positions.  AWS will only become increasingly popular in the future, and the training provided the best method for understanding all of its complex features.  I enjoyed that there were methods by which to follow along and apply the knowledge hands-on, and quizzes to check our knowledge.  While the videos can sometimes be dull or difficult to pay attention to, they were helpful to reference when I had difficulty with any of the hands-on activities.

My favorite training this semester was the PowerBI.  I am especially interested in data visualization and found the PowerBI training to be the most entertaining and useful.  Overall, I did not have much trouble with any of the trainings - some features would not work the first time or two, but only required a few minutes of troubleshooting to fix the problem.  Each training took approximately the time that was listed and had all required features available to complete the steps. I did not complete the PowerShell training but may in the future to be better prepared for client jobs that may involve it.
