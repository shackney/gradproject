<summary>Internship Experience</summary>

Coming into college at the University of Tulsa, I declared a major in accounting but was unsure whether it would be a good fit for me.  After my first few accounting courses, I discovered that I was really enjoying the course content and figured a career in accounting would be stable, secure, and dependable.  Along the way, I took CIS2003, which essentially provided an introductory overview to a lot of CIS topics that were expanded upon in more advanced courses.  This CIS course was part of the course requirement for all students with business majors, so I enrolled out of obligation.  However, I found that I was fairly adept at mastering the subject matter and looked further into the possibility of studying CIS in addition to accounting.  I attended an informational luncheon with all of the CIS professors to learn more about what the major would entail. Throughout the rest of my undergraduate years, I switched a few times back and forth between a CIS major and a minor, but ultimately was able to fit the requirements for a major into my courseload.  
<br>
When it came time to think about career paths, I knew I would prefer a job that would appeal to my interests in both accounting and CIS.  I figured that there were a few different options: corporate accounting, auditor, or IT auditor.  I aimed to try each of these in hopes of discovering what I could see myself doing on a daily basis for an extended period of time.  My first internship was with Phillips 66 the summer after my sophomore year.  I served as a finance intern in the marketing financial services group.  I found this internship to be a great first experience.  My specific sub-group dealt with fuel consignment and accounting for stations that owned the brick and mortar gas station but sold Phillips 66 fuel.  The internship was a whole provided a complete look into the oil and gas value chain.  The intern class took trips to the Houston headquarters, Ponca City refinery, Glenpool terminals, and several other sites.  On a daily basis, much of my responsibility was to receive reports from the consignment operator detailing their sales, fuel volumes, etc and reconciling this to the company ERP. I was tasked with finding errors in the report and performing several analytics procedures to find any unusual trends.  I was also given a second project that involved creating a macro in Excel to format incoming aviation fuel sales data in a way that was compatible with direct entry into their system. While I loved the company culture and the internship as a whole, I felt my specific position was not fast-paced enough to entertain me for 40 hours a week, and began thinking about other options for work.
<br>
During the following school year, I discussed with my CIS professors options for my next internship.  Once suggestion I was given was for Stinnett & Associates, a firm that was not extremely involved on the TU campus at that point.  However, two company representatives attended a fall Beta Alpha Psi meeting, at which time I approached them and expressed my interest in an internship.  I went through the hiring process which included an office tour, and accepted an internship for the following summer.  I expressed to them that I was interested in both the accounting and IT aspect of things; they offered to allow me experience in both areas throughout the summer.  Stinnett is essentially a client services firm, and a majority of the jobs I was on included outsourced auditing or IT work for clients.
